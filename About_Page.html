    <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Isabel Carter is an adult in her early 40's with three children and her spouse. She calls herself a third generation hobby artist. Her grandmother and mother both held jobs but were artists in their own rights. Her grandmother preferred oil paints and canvas, though she sometimes used paper, pencil and charcoals. She also crocheted, sewed and made many crafty items to relax or keep her hands busy while watching tv or listening to music. Isabel's mother usually used paper and pencil when she would draw. She used colored pencils and crayons to color in coloring books and also was very handy with crafts, like her mother. Seeing these women using these talents is what gave Isabel her interest in art.</p>

      <p>Isabel started drawing as soon as she could hold a writing utensil. Her first recognizable artwork was at the age of three when she drew a mother and baby elephant next to a lake in crayon. At first, she would draw what she could see or what she thought other people might enjoy. She used her skills in grade school to illustrate some of her work in English, Reading and History classes. Isabel continued practicing skills even after some art teachers denied her a chance in their classes, due to not having taken basic art classes, in high school. By this time, she was more interested in drawing and painting realistic images- with an emphasis on people and animals. Anytime there was an art book she could get her hands on, she would look through and pick up tips and techniques to try. However, most of what she learned was through trial and error.</p>
  
      <p>As the years passed, her grandmother downsized her art supplies and Isabel inherited some partially finished art pieces, most half finished with a 70's color palette. When she passed away, Isabel decided to finish some of her grandmother's art pieces. She used a latex primer to be able to use acrylic paint over the oil paints. She brightened up the 70's palette but kept the original subject matter of each piece- landscapes. This was a new challenge for her since she never really attempted it before.</p>
  
      <p>Now that art can be made digitally, Isabel has branched out into the digital medium as well. After taking a class in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, she's enjoying making art that is less likely to harm the environment. She's still learning new skills and techniques and is also working on a web design degree.</p>
