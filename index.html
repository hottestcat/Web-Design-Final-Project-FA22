          <ul>
            <li>"This artist has a way with the colors and subject that truly makes the piece come alive. She made an extremely beautiful portrait of my favorite animal, a wolf, for my home that still serves as a conversation starter. Vibrant, life like and finely detailed. Definitely a talented artist."- M.D.</li>
            <li>"The painting this artist did for me is absolutely my favorite. The attention to detail is phenomenal and I would definitely purchase another piece!"- O.N.</li>
            <li>"There are so many details in her art pieces that just don't show up in a photograph. The little detailed strokes in the realistic works and the nuances of colors or texture in the abstract pieces."- J.L.</li>
